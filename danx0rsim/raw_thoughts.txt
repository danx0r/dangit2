NightShift:

* DayShift is interactions (conversations) - receive input, react

* NightShift is review, reflect, remember

The 5 R's:

1 Receive: user prompts
2 React: respond to user
3 Review: study recent session (offline)
4 Reflect: sentiment analysis as loss function (was user happy/neutral/frustrated?)
5 Remember: fine-tune incorporating new data (LORA) - also db? (vector?)
